        <h2>How It All Began</h2>
        <p>When I was in high school, I was so terrified by the cost of college that I applied to 46 scholarships in senior year. The most common piece of advice was to apply to as many scholarships as possible - especially to any that were local - to maximize my chances. This piece of advice came with two caveats. If I were to apply to as many as possible, how do I keep track of them? How do I even find the ones that are local?</p>

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this webpage is to cut through the noise of what’s out there. There are scholarship websites that have lists upon lists you have to dig through to find out what’s right for you. There are also scholarship websites that spam you with so many reminders that you stop reading their emails altogether. This resource is none of those. It’s an organizational tool created for the students, from the high schooler to the postdoctoral researcher.</p>
